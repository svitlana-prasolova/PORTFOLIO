#  Applications Rating Analysis
**Data cleaning, merging, and applicant rating calculation using Python and Pandas**
This project focuses on analyzing application data from two CSV files ‚Äî applications.csv and industries.csv.
The goal is to clean and enrich the data, calculate individual application ratings, and determine the average weekly rating of accepted applications.

## Project Task:
Develop a Python-based data analysis workflow to calculate and visualize application ratings.
- The project involves cleaning and merging datasets, 
- applying rating rules to each applicant,
- filtering accepted applications,
- and analyzing average weekly ratings

## Results
- Cleaned and enriched applicant data.
- Automated the rating calculation logic based on multiple business rules.
- Calculated average weekly ratings for accepted applications.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Conditional calculations using Pandas
- Merging datasets
- Weekly grouping & aggregation
- Data visualization

### ## üîπ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
