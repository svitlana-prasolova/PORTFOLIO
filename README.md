## üìç About
Hi, I'm Svitlana. I am a scientist, and now my area of interest is data analytics. As a Data analyst with practical experience in data analysis, product analytics, finance, and statistical research, I am skilled in SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy), Google Sheets, Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI, data visualization, A/B testing. 
Completed analysis of advertising campaigns and product performance, identifying key factors affecting user engagement and conversion rates. Seeking a role to apply analytical skills and support data-driven business decisions. I am skilled in most data-science steps: data pre-processing, data analysis, data visualization, and results communication.
Recently completed the  Data Analytics Certificate - a rigorous, hands-on program that covers the entire scope of the data analysis process.

On this page, you can find some examples of my projects. Have fun in browsing through the content, and thank you for visiting!

#  Applications Rating Analysis
**Data cleaning, merging, and applicant rating calculation using Python and Pandas**
This project focuses on analyzing application data from two CSV files ‚Äî applications.csv and industries.csv.
The goal is to clean and enrich the data, calculate individual application ratings, and determine the average weekly rating of accepted applications.

## Project Task:
Develop a Python-based data analysis workflow to calculate and visualize application ratings.
- The project involves cleaning and merging datasets, 
- applying rating rules to each applicant,
- filtering accepted applications,
- and analyzing average weekly ratings

## Results
- Cleaned and enriched applicant data.
- Automated the rating calculation logic based on multiple business rules.
- Calculated average weekly ratings for accepted applications.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Conditional calculations using Pandas
- Merging datasets
- Weekly grouping & aggregation
- Data visualization

### ## üîπ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

# Facebook Ads Time-series & ROMI Analysis
### Author: Svitlana Prasolova

## Project Description
Analysis of Facebook advertising performance using a Jupyter Notebook and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn). The notebook loads facebook_ads_data.csv, performs daily and campaign-level aggregations, computes ROMI, visualizes trends and distributions, inspects correlations, and fits a regression between ad spend and value.

## Project Task:
Through the use of Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project demonstrates how to:
- Analyze daily advertising spend and ROMI across 2021;
- Apply moving averages to smooth time-series data;
- Compare campaign-level efficiency via bar charts and box plots;
- Visualize ROMI distribution and correlation between performance metrics;
- Build a regression model to explore the relationship between total_spend and total_value.
The outcome is a complete analytical notebook that supports data-driven insights into Facebook Ads effectiveness and campaign optimization.

## Results
The analysis provided a clear view of advertising effectiveness:
- Identified campaigns with the highest ROMI.
- Visualized daily trends and seasonal patterns in advertising spend.
- Identified strong correlations between ad spend, impressions, clicks, and total value.

A complete analytical notebook that delivers data-driven insights into Facebook Ads campaign performance, helping to optimize marketing budgets and improve ROMI.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preparation with Pandas.
- Daily and campaign-level performance analysis.
- ROMI calculation and time-series visualization.
- Correlation and regression analysis (lmplot).
- Data storytelling with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Tools & Technologies
- Language: Python
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
