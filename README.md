# eCommerce Funnel Analysis in BigQuery and GA4
### Author: Svitlana Prasolova

## Project Description
This project explores user behavior and sales funnel performance for an eCommerce platform, based on raw event data from Google Analytics 4 (GA4). The analysis was conducted in BigQuery to extract, transform, and interpret data on events, users, and sessions.

## Project Task:
‚Ä¢	Creating queries to retrieve event-level data  with time formatting via TIMESTAMP_MICROS and filtering by _TABLE_SUFFIX for the year 2021.
‚Ä¢	Using DISTINCT and UNNEST operators to flatten the nested structure of the event_params field (type RECORD) ‚Äî converting it into a relational format for further processing.
‚Ä¢	Selecting only the defined funnel events and bilding a multi-step conversion funnel from session start to purchase, segmented by date, traffic source, medium, and campaign using subqueries and CTEs.
‚Ä¢	Applying filters (IN, IF) to include relevant events and prevent division by zero during conversion rate calculations.
‚Ä¢	Merging user engagement and purchase data with LEFT JOIN to identify the correlation between engagement time and purchase completion.

## Conclusion:
The executed SQL scripts successfully generated clean, structured outputs, which were later used for visualization and BI reporting.
Main findings:
‚Ä¢	Only 1 in 6 visitors who started a session completed a purchase ‚Äî indicating potential for funnel optimization at registration and checkout stages.
‚Ä¢	Facebook Ads channels showed higher engagement rates but required cost efficiency improvements.
‚Ä¢	Redesign/Accessories and Redesign/Apparel campaigns demonstrated 100% conversion from session start to purchase ‚Äî likely targeting a niche VIP audience.
‚Ä¢	Correlation analysis revealed an almost zero correlation between the engagement flag (is_engaged) and purchase, but a stronger correlation between total engagement time and purchase activity..
üìà Recommendation:
To improve overall funnel performance and boost sales, focus on simplifying user registration and checkout flow, while maintaining attention on campaigns that demonstrate strong conversion consistency (e.g., Redesign/Accessories).

## Results
‚Ä¢	Generated accurate and reproducible SQL outputs addressing all analytical objectives.
‚Ä¢	Extracted and analyzed GA4 data to build a complete eCommerce conversion funnel.
‚Ä¢	Identified top-performing campaigns and key traffic sources driving conversions.
‚Ä¢	Revealed insights on user engagement, purchase behavior, and campaign efficiency

# A/B Test ‚Äî Subscription Conversion Optimization
### Author: Svitlana Prasolova

## Project Description
#### Goal: To determine whether emphasizing a ‚Äú50% discount‚Äù message on the subscription screen increases purchase conversion compared to the standard $4.99 offer.
The experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of visual pricing cues on user conversion.
Two user groups participated: 
- Group A (Control): Standard $4.99 subscription screen;
- Group B (Variant): Same $4.99 offer labeled as '50% discount'.

## Project Task:
- Design and run an A/B test on the subscription screen.
- Compare user conversion between control (A) and variant (B) groups.
- Evaluate statistical significance using a hypothesis test.
- Visualize conversion rates with 95% confidence intervals.
- Draw business conclusions and decide on rollout.

### Conclusions about the A/B test results:
#### Context:
The goal of the A/B test was to determine whether a 50% discount (group B) affects the conversion rate of users compared to the standard price of $4.99 (group A).
The test was conducted for 21 days: from 2023-07-03 to 2023-07-25,
the data contains the timestamp of each event (timestamp)
and the fact of performing the target action (conversion = 1/0).
##### Data validity check:
- The data type by dates was converted to datetime format, which allowed tracking the change in conversion over time.
- The average conversion level in groups A and B was calculated for each day.
- The visualization showed stable user activity throughout the testing period without significant gaps in the data.

## Results
The A/B test ran for 21 days (July 3‚Äì25, 2023) and revealed a significant uplift in conversion for the variant with the ‚Äú50% discount‚Äù label.
Group A: 6.10% conversion
Group B: 8.90% conversion
t-statistic = ‚àí7.53, p-value ‚âà 0.0 ‚Üí significant at Œ± = 0.05 The discount design consistently outperformed the control version across the entire test period.
### Key findings:
| Metric          | Group A ($4.99)            | Group B (50% discount)                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Users           | 10,013                     | 9,985                                  |
| Conversions     | 611                        | 889                                    |
| Conversion Rate | **6.1%**                   | **8.9%**                               |
| t-statistic     | ‚àí7.53                      |                                        |
| p-value         | 0.00                       |                                        |
| Result          | ‚ùå Null hypothesis rejected | ‚úÖ Statistically significant difference |
The introduction of a 50% discount led to a significant increase in conversions. The effect is statistically significant and stable over time.

#### Recommendations:
- Decide to implement the discount model (group B) as the main pricing policy for this user segment.
- Conduct additional profitability analysis: although conversion has increased, it is important to check whether the increase in the number of purchases compensates for the loss of revenue due to the reduced price.
- If necessary, test smaller discounts (for example, 30% or 20%) to find the optimal balance between sales volume and margin.
